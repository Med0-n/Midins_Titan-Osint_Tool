## ✨ Key Features (V1.1.0)

### 📂 Case Management & Dashboard
* **Investigation Dashboard:** Save, rename, load, or delete multiple investigations. Everything is stored locally.
* **Smart Persistence:** Automatic saving of nodes, edges, and counters. Your workspace stays exactly as you left it.

### 🔍 Smart Intelligence & Mapping
* **Auto-Scraping:** Drop a URL to instantly pull the Site Title and Official Logo.
* **Variable System (%s):** Create custom variables to pivot your research across multiple external tools instantly.
* **Drag & Drop:** Drop images or files directly onto the canvas. Images are automatically compressed and stored as nodes.

### 🕸️ Advanced UX & Interactions
* **Properties Panel:** Right-hand panel for deep customization of nodes and edges (colors, shapes, sizes, comments).
* **Double-Click Actions:** Instant copy-to-clipboard for node labels or URLs.
* **Stable Layout:** Undo/Redo system that preserves exact node positions. No more "auto-jumping" nodes.
* **Smart Placement:** New nodes automatically find free space on the canvas to avoid stacking.

### 🛡️ Privacy & Sovereignty
* **100% Local:** Runs on a local Flask server. No cloud, no tracking, no external logs. Total confidentiality.
